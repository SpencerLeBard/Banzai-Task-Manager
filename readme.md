# Banzai Task Manager 

A Kanban board is a method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively. This application will provide users with a digital Kanban board, where they can manage several lists of tasks for each board.
